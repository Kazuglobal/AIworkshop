# Data Model and Supabase Schema

This rule provides guidance on the data structure used in the Culture Bridge Program 2025 Web Platform, primarily managed by Supabase.

## Supabase Database Structure

The backend relies on Supabase, utilizing its Postgres database, authentication, storage, realtime capabilities, and edge functions. The data model is designed to support the platform's features and user roles.

### Key Tables (Examples)

The PRD outlines examples of the core tables:

*   `users`: Stores common information for all user roles (students, mentors, admins).
*   `groups`: Defines student groups, their themes, members, and assigned mentors.
*   `resources`: Manages shared resources like articles, links, and documents.
*   `works`: Tracks student submissions, content, status, and links to feedback.
*   `feedback`: Stores feedback provided on student work.
*   `messages`: Contains chat messages for groups and direct communication.

For the example SQL schema and more details on the data structure, please refer to section 5 of the [CURSOR_PRD.md](mdc:CURSOR_PRD.md).

## Row Level Security (RLS)

Supabase's Row Level Security (RLS) will be crucial for ensuring users can only access and modify data they are permitted to. The design of RLS policies is a key part of the database setup (see section 1.3 of [PROJECT_TASKS.md](mdc:PROJECT_TASKS.md)).

Understanding this data model is essential for developing backend logic, APIs, and frontend components that interact with the data.
