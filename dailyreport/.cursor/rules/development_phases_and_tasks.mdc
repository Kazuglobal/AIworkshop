# Development Phases and Task Management

This rule explains how the Culture Bridge Program 2025 Web Platform project is structured into development phases and how tasks are managed.

## Project Phases

The project is broken down into several key phases, from planning and design to deployment and maintenance. These phases provide a structured approach to development and ensure all aspects of the PRD are covered.

The detailed breakdown of tasks for each phase can be found in the Project Tasks document: [PROJECT_TASKS.md](mdc:PROJECT_TASKS.md)

Key phases include:
1.  **Phase 1: Planning & Design** (Detailed requirements, UI/UX, DB design, API design, Infrastructure)
2.  **Phase 2: Development Environment Setup**
3.  **Phase 3: Backend Development (Supabase)** (DB construction, Auth, APIs, Storage, Realtime)
4.  **Phase 4: Frontend Development** (Common components, Pages for each user role, Features like resource search, work submission, PDF download, multilingual support)
5.  **Phase 5: Integration & Testing** (Unit, Integration, E2E, Usability, Performance, Security)
6.  **Phase 6: Release Preparation & Deployment**
7.  **Phase 7: Operations & Maintenance**

## Task Management

Tasks within each phase are itemized with checkboxes for progress tracking. This helps in understanding the current development stage and upcoming work.
Referencing [PROJECT_TASKS.md](mdc:PROJECT_TASKS.md) will provide clarity on specific tasks and their status (once updated with progress).
